"Composing for Jazz Orchestra" by Russo William admits six chord types
(with atonal base prime form, but Jazz allows chord alterations that
would change the pitch set involved):

* Major [0,3,7] "all major and perfect intervals"
* Minor [0,3,7] "all major and perfect intervals, excepting the minor 3rd"
* Minor 7th [0,3,5,8] "all major and perfect intervals except for minor
  3rd and 7th"
* Dom 7th [0,2,5,8] "major 3rd and minor 7th" (also, augmented triads
  "major 3rd and diminished 5th?" - hmmm)
* Dim 7th [0,3,6,9] "minor 3rd and diminished 5th"
* Leading Tone 7th [0,2,5,8] - double diminished
*

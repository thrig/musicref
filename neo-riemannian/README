See also the Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz module on CPAN, in particular
the eg/nrt-study-setclass program in the distribution of that module.

For the PNG, "fn" is the forte number, and invaryN how many pitches were
held invarient when computing the links. Some pointers:

 * fn3-11.invary2.png (major, minor triads)
 * fn3-6.invary2.png - compare with 3-11
 * fn4-27.invary2.png (sevenths (well, some of them, anyways))
 * fn4-27.invary3.png - too many invarient pitches, nothing to do!
 * intervals/modes-of-limited-transposition of this repository are
   interesting when run through eg/nrt-study-setclass: zero linkages.

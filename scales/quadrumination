Consider four adjacent intervals, where there is one semitone (S) and
three whole tones (T). The possibilities are:

  STTT    c des ees f   g
  TSTT    c d   ees f   g
  TTST    c d   e   f   g
  TTTS    c d   e   fis g

These can be joined with another unit either in a disjunct or conjunct
fashion; disjunct merely appends another unit (so, STTTSTTT) while with
conjunct there is an overlap between the units:

    STTT
  +    TSTT
    -------
  = STTTSTT

The possible single-note conjunct thus consist of:

  STTTSTT e f g a b c d e        phrygian
  STTTTST e f g a b cis d e      phrygian to minor on VII?
  STTTTTS e f g a b cis dis e    phrygian up to major (melodic phy?)

  TSTTSTT c d ees f g aes bes c  minor
  TSTTTST c d ees f g a bes c    dorian
  TSTTTTS c d ees f g a b c      melodic minor

  TTSTSTT c d e f g aes bes c    minor (raised III) or melodic major down to V
  TTSTTST c d e f g a bes c      major from V (or minor on VII)
  TTSTTTS c d e f g a b c        major

  TTTSTTT f g a b c d e fis      lydian (perfect IV)

Other scales could be constructed by allowing for more than one note of
overlap between the conjunct sets; what the disjunct permutations map
out to may also be interesting.

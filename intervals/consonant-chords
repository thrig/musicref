So wikipedia artice on Consonance & Dissonance has an image link
containing the following; I've added atonal prime form and ICC and other
ruminations.

1. Triads consisting of three consonances:

   <c ees g>		[0,3,7] 001110
   <c e g>

   <c e aes>		[0,4,8] 000300

"Counterpoint in Composition" p.28 ex 1-62 allows the above, and also:

   <d f b>		[0,3,6] 002001
   (but only in this formulation, with tritone on top)

2. Triads consisting of two consonances and one mild dissonance:

   <c d a'>		[0,2,5] 011010
   <c g' a>
   <c ees bes'>
   <c g' bes>

   So one major second, ic2.

3. Triads consisting of one consonance and two mild dissonances:

   <c d e>		[0,2,4] 020100
   <c d bes'>
   <c aes' bes'>

   Two major seconds or 2x ic2.

4. Triads consisting of two consonances and a sharp dissonance:

   <c des e>		[0,1,4] 101100
   <c des a'>
   <c dis e>
   <c ees b'>
   <c gis' a>
   <c aes' b>

   <c des aes'>		[0,1,5] 100110
   <c e b'>
   <c g' aes>
   <c g' b>

5. Triads consisting of one consonance, one mild dissonance, and a sharp
   dissonance:

   <c des ees>		[0,1,3] 111000
   <c des bes'>
   <c d ees>
   <c d b'>
   <c a' bes>
   <c a' b>

6. Triads consisting of one mild dissonance, and two sharp ones:

   <bis cis d>		[0,1,2] 210000
   <c des b'>
   <c ais' b>

So atonal prime form and ICC do indicate dissonance, with more and more
sharply dissonance favoring ic2 and ic1 interval counts, while consonant
chords show more even spread across the octave. But this would require
human inspection to derive, or some algorithm that weights the ICC
members in addition to how closely the chord is spaced.

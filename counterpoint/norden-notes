Notes taken on "Fundamental Counterpoint" by Hugo Norden

Intervals allowed:

 * Ma/mi 2nd, up or down, 
 * Ma/mi 3rd, up or down
 * P4, up or down
 * Diminished 5th, up or down (and ideally reverse motion step compensated)
 * P5, up or down
 * Minor 6th, up or down.
 * Octave, up or down.

Intervals *not* allowed:

 * Major 6th, up or down
 * Ma/mi 7th, up or down
 * All diminished or augmented intervals besides dim. 5th.
 * All intervals >8va

Sequential motion in same direction not allowed when the notes outline:

 * Augmented 4th (either direction), e.g. f1 g b
 * Ma/mi 7th (either dir.) e.g. e a d
 * Ma/mi 9th (")

Following combinations of three sequential moves in same direction not
permitted:

 * Ma/mi 3rds in any combination, as these would outline a 7th
 * Ma 2nds if run outlines a Aug. 4th (e.g. ... g -> f g a b <- a ...);
   however, okay if run does not outline aug. 4th by not changing
   direction, e.g. g -> f g a b c <-

Normal range of contrapuntal melody is one octave, but can dip outside
by one note on either side. (10th)


1st species rules (two voices)

* Unison, Mm3, P5, Mm6, 8va allowed
* ... except Unison only in 1st/last measure
* 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th may be expanded by octave (compound 
  intervals) - 10, 12, 13, 15 or 3+8, 5+8, 6+8, 8+8, but using the
  music funny -1 math.
* However, large intervals are dubious, or should only be used 
  sparingly. 
* Voices are allowed to cross (then the interval would be, say, 5, -3, 6
  for <a e'> <f' d> <b, g'>) if this improves the melody, and the 
  crossing is done via contrary motion. Use sparingly to avoid confusing
  the lines.
* Overlapping not permitted, e.g. when lower voice moves in same 
  direction as upper to a higher note than the preceding note in the
  upper voice.
* No motion in same direction to Unison, 5th, 8va. (direct)
* Consecutive 5ths, 8ths forbidden.
* C.F. allows U, 5th, 8th start above, but only U, 8th if other
  voice is below.
* One cadence formula available: 6 to 8, or 3 to U intervals.
* Cross relations (diagonal augmented 4th) forbidden -- hmm, but only
  when intervals are 3,3 or 5,3 or 3,5, and nowhere else?
* >3 3rds or 6ths not permitted in sucession, as these weaken the
  counterpoint due to repeated similar motion.

* Many more traps in minor from above rules (two dim. 5ths, aug. 5th,
  dim. 4th) due to sharpening of VI VII possible in minor.
* "Higher level" forms from literal imitation (likely at offset),
  retrograde imitation, contrary motion, contrary motion and retrograde,
  palindromes in the voices. Imitation/retrograde might be used later in
  the same voice, e.g. pattern A in C.F., imitated in the new voice,
  then done with retrograde later in new voice, assuming the C.F. allows.


2nd Species

* Four allowed dischords:
  1. On the downbeat as descending passing note between two concords -
     10 in upbeat of previous measure, then 7 on downbeat, 6 on upbeat.
  2. On the upbeat as ascending passing note (e.g. 3-4-6 intervals).
  3. On the upbeat as descending passing note (8-7-3).
  4. On the upbeat as a downward aux. note. 10-9-6; c b c.
* Discords are Ma/mi 2nd, P4, Ma/mi 7th, all dim. & aug. intervals (what
  happened to the major 6th? or is that considered aug.?)
* Therefore concords to be connected melodically must be 3rd apart or on
  same note, and all accented (downbeat) discords must come in
  descending scale line.
* Unison (apart from ending) may now occur on downbeat, and ideally by a
  leap, to avoid descending passing 2-1 progression. (But no rule
  against such.)
* 2nd species response begins after 1/2 rest.
* Same cadential formula as from 1st species.
* :( missing p.28-29						TODO
* Discords must be approached and departed by a step.
* Discords in minor can be problematic, e.g. #VII-#VI-#VII only
  possibility (which Schoenberg would frown on, as he never had #VII to
  #VI as allowed to begin with).
* #VI may be used as ASC discord, but only on upbeat.

3rd Species

* First beat must not be discord nor unison; except unison as previously
  is allowed in ultimate measure.
* First beat of first measure must be rest.
* Discord rules for 3rd quarter note same as for downbeat half note in
  2nd species; 2nd and 4th qn as for the upbeat rules from 2nd species.
  excepting the ultimate qn in the penultimate measure, where cadence
  rules take effect.
* First note of counterpoint must be conchord, however (2nd quarter note
  in 1st measure of the response line).
* Additionally, "Note Cambiata" allowed (but not beginning on leading-
  tone, as would outline tritone). << { a4 g e f g ... } // { d1 e } >> or
  << { a1 g } // { c,4 b g a b ... } >>
* Additionally, "changing notes" allowed to ascend by 2nd from 1st beat
  of measure M to 1st beat of M+1. << { e4 f d e f ... } // { c1 ... }
* Additionally, "descending four note scalewise passage" allowed,
  subsequent measure will need to step down (5th) or up (3rd) to create
  one or the other larger-scale motion.
* Incorrect placements of consecutive 5th or 8va can occur between beats
  1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 3:1, 4:1.
* 2:2, 3:3, 4:4 with consecutive unisons would also be an error.
* *every* measure, except first and last, *must* contain a discord (!).
  So cannot outline a chord, or jump around on conchords.
* However, 6-5 or 5-6 depending on accented start or not, the unaccented
  becomes a discord. These could be aux. or passing notes, though
  diagrams not clear to me (are all the examples on unaccented note thus
  considered discords?).
* Upward leap from 1st beat of measure should be avoided (as partially
  outlines a triad?).
* After >= 3 scalewise notes, do not leap across measure line in the
  same direction.
* Nine (well, eleven) cadential figures are allowed (4,5,8 of
  questionable value) above the C.F.
  1. << { b4 c a b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  2. << { a4 g a b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  3. << { f4 d c b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  4. << { f4 e f b, c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  5. << { f4 d a b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  6. << { a4 d, a b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  7. << { a4 f a, b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  8. << { a4 d, c b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  9. << { f4 g a b c1 } // { d,1 c } >>
  10. << { f4 d a' b c1 } // { d,1 c } >> (variation on 5)
  11. << { a4 d, a' b c1 } // { d,1 c } >> (variation on 6)
* 3rd species below C.F. only one additional rule: avoid a leap of
  4th or 5th from an accented beat to an unaccented one. (Outlines a
  6/4 chord.)
* But leap of 4th or 5th from unaccented to accented is good.
* With counterpoint below, only 1, 3 from above list acceptable.
* Five harmonic effects possible in strict counterpoint:
  1. Major triad, root pos
  2. Minor triad, root pos
  3. Major triad, 1st inversion
  4. Minor triad, 1st inversion
  5. Diminished triad, 1st inversion, and provided that root of triad
     placed above the fifth.
* Rate of harmonic change must be one per measure, or two per
  measure, but only if the change occurs on the 3rd qn. (This implies
  a rhythm of whole note, half-half, or ... half half~half half ties
  across a measure.)
* Implied harmony below may not always seem clear, esp. with
  descending passing-note on 3rd beat, in which case 4th qn determines
  the implied harmony.
* Leaps across measure line, from best to less good - only after a leap
  in opposite direction, after a leap in same direction, and
  compensating for a scalewise line.
* ASC leap after ASC leap, first should be approached from opposite
  direction, ideally by step.
* Leap after scalewise only possibe if scalewise downwards, and 3rd qn a
  passing note (b). << { e4 c b a f' } // { c,1 d } >>
* Scalewise arcs should not hit leading tone at highest, nor subdom at
  lowest (perhaps to avoid modulatory effects?)
* Mixing leaps and scalewise in same direction best done by placing leap
  at beginning of passage, then stick to scalewise.
